Citizens with more freedom to make life choices generally have fewer perceptions of corruption. Furthermore, Western Europe and North America and ANZ are the happiest regions from their continuous preeminence in key categories, including social support and healthy life expectancy. When analyzing data based on regional indicators, it is important to consider region sizes. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for nearly a quarter of all analyzed countries, while North America and ANZ accounted for under 5%.')
